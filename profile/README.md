## Hi there 👋 Thanks for visiting!

[Learn To Program Roanoke](https://learntoprogramroanoke.github.io/)

🙋‍♀️ Visit the website if you'd like. Not much there, unfortunately.

🍿 The repositories do contain some useful code examples. Feel free to browse around. 

Just keep in mind no active development has happened the past three years.

This project has stalled due to the pandemic. Hope to resume activity again in 2023/2024.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
